README:

There are four R program files. The name of the files would be self-explanatory. The following are the things that needs to be done
for each of the files before running them.

1. On the first line, type the path where the dataset (income or iris depending on the program you open) can be found on your computer.
2. On the second, type the path where you want the final output file(.csv) to be stored.
3. On the third line, the value of k can be set.

4. For the program with the income dataset, there will be fourth line which would have been commented. This subsets the income data to the first 100 rows.
   Since the program takes a while to finish computing for all the 520 rows, you can choose to run the program only for the first 100 rows by uncommenting this 
   line. THis will make the program run faster.

5. The output can be seen as a csv file saved on the path mentioned in 2. Alternatively, the dataframe 'final' has the final results. You can choose to view t
   hat dataframe in R directly.


Thanks! :)
